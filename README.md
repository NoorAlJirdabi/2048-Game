### **_Description_**

Project 1 for General Assembly bootcamp, A sliding tile puzzle game is called 2048. Sliding numbered tiles on a 4x4 grid to create a tile with the number 2048 is the aim of the game. When two identical tiles collide while moving in the same direction, they combine to form a single tile that has a sum of its numerical values. When a player creates a tile with the value 2048, they win, however, they can keep playing to make tiles with higher values.
